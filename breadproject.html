      <h1>Baking every bread in alphabetical order!</h1>
      <p>In late 2024, I got the weird idea to try baking every entry in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_breads">Wikipedia list of breads</a>, in alphabetical order.
         This endeavor has gotten me to try things I never would have thought of trying, to bake or to eat.
      </p>
      <p>I will try to snap the ingredients as well as the outcome, to give a sense of what's involved in each recipe.</p>
 
      <h2>Anadama bread</h2>
      <p>This is apparently a traditional bread from New England, but despite having lived 1/3 of my life in Massachusetts, I had never heard of it. I asked around and some New England natives knew it, and pronunciation was mixed between Anna-damn-uh and Ahna-dom-uh.
          It's a fairly ordinary yeast bread, baked in a tin, but with the addition of cornmeal and molasses. 
          Legend has it that the name comes from a man exclaiming "Anna, damn her" after growing fed up with his wife's meals of cornmeal mush and molasses, and inventing this bread in order to break the monotony of consuming these ingredients.
       </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.carolinescooking.com/anadama-bread/">It's an easy recipe</a> and would make a great introduction to yeasted breads. 
      </p> 
      <img src="assets/anadama_ingredients.jpg" width=300/>
      <p>It was delicious served warm with butter, but then, what isn't? But it was pretty stale on day 2. I bet it would make great french toast.
      </p>

    <h2>Anpan</h2>
    <p>Anpans are lovely little yeast buns, usually filled with red bean paste and marked on top with a circle of sesame black seeds. 
      They were invented in Japan in 1875 by Yasubei Kimura, an ex-samurai who became a baker after the samurai class was dissolved.</p>
   <p>
      Anpanman, a superhero with an anpan for a head, is the subject of a children's picture book and anime series that teaches children about germs and food safety.
   Other characters can take a bite out of his head to regain their strength. Fortunately the baker character can just make him a new head.</p>
   <p>
      <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/anpan/">The recipe I used</a> involved a lot of kneading. It suggested a slapping technique where you whack the bread against the counter. I made this in November 2024 and it was honestly extremely therapeutic. But I think I kneaded so vigorously that I may have actually killed some of the yeast through mechanical injury. I definitely didn't get as much of a rise as the recipe said I was supposed to. The texture was a bit dense- almost like a bagel. Unfortunately I've never had the chance to try an anpan that was made by someone who knew what they were doing, so I don't know if that texture is intended. At some point I will make them again and try to get them fluffier.
   </p>
   <img src="assets/anpan_ingredients.jpg" width=300/>
   <p>
   I wanted the beautiful contrast of black sesame seeds without the price, so I substituted black poppy seeds. 
   I also got my red beans at Market Basket and realized later that they were Central American red silk beans (frijol rojo de seda), which are a bit kidney-shaped (but not the same as kidney beans) and yet not the mung beans / adzuki beans used in East Asia. But they cooked down into a tasty red paste all the same.

   <h2>Appams</h2>
   <p>Appams are coconut and rice flour fritters popular in the state of Kerala, India. You can tear off pieces and use them to scoop up other foods. Or you can serve food in them, like a bread bowl, because they're cooked in a wok-shaped pan and come out bowl-shaped.
      The edges should be lacey from the popped bubbles, and browned to a crisp, while the middle should be stark white, soft, and fluffy. 
      Notably, this is our first gluten-free bread on the list and it's also vegan.  Paired with lentil curry, this is a nice option for diners with dietary restrictions.
   </p>
  <p>Appams are traditionally leavened with "toddy" or palm wine, which contains wild yeast. The sap from palm trees can be collected in the morning and by the afternoon the yeast has already fermented into something fairly boozy.
    Without access to fresh toddy, I resorted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=METruOPZ-2Y&list=PLrFfR1mtZCLFQZRPsGaCqb0JEwG8DPOsx">this lovely video recipe</a> that shows how to use dried yeast instead.
    It also gives options for using grated coconut or coconut milk.</p>
    <p>On my first attempt, I used coconut milk and I tried to make my own rice flour by grinding up raw rice. 
      It turns out I don't have a fancy enough blender for that, so my rice "flour" was too coarse and kept sinking out of the batter.
      On my second try I used store-bought rice powder and I decided to try grated coconut. This version worked much better for me.
   </p>
   <img src="assets/appam_ingredients.jpg" width=400/>
   <p>
      I found that making the appam batter is not hard, but there's a lot of technique in getting them properly cooked. You need to ladle in the right amount of batter,
      swirl the pan properly so that you get thin crispy edges and a thicker middle, use the right amount of heat while covering the pan to steam the middle,
      and use more heat and oil on the sides to get the edges to lift off the pan. It takes practice, and the right technique probably depends a lot on the pan. I used a nonstick wok, which seemed not ideal, but I learned to make it work.
   </p>
   <p>I was rewarded with crisp on the edges, fluffy in the middle, white and brown hoppers that smelled strongly of coconut. They made an ordinary lentil curry much more fun to eat. 
      I wasn't sure if the leftover batter would keep in the fridge, but I did try making some more a couple days later, and to my surprise they smelled less of coconut and had developed a more complex fermented flavor.

   <h2>Apple bread</h2>
   <p>Apple bread is a snack bread from Taiwan that's commonly available in bakeries and supermarkets.
      Despite the name, it doesn't have to contain apples. 
      Apples were just a luxury good at the time and were therefore used in the branding. 
      I guess it's like Diamond brand nuts.
      I've had trouble finding clear recipes, maybe because this isn't something people normally make at home, so I haven't made it yet.
   </p>

   <h2>Arboud</h2>
   <p>Arboud is an ancient Bedouin flatbread cooked directly in the embers of a wood fire.
      Bedouins are traditionally nomadic, hence this low-tech method that doesn't require a stove or even a pan.
      Unfortunately, in my apartment I'm not allowed to burn candles, let alone a whole firepit,
   so I'll have to wait for camping weather and then circle back to this one. </p>
   <p>Update: I went camping and made arboud! My expectations were pretty low since I didn't have a recipe,
      and since cooking bread directly IN a firepit sounded like something that would require a lot of subtle technique to get right.
      However, I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and will probably make it next time I'm camping! 
      The crust was extremely crisp, while the inside was soft and fluffy. 
      (This texture achievement actually makes sense because wood coals burn very hot- easily hotter than the hottest domestic frying pan- so the outside cooks rapidly.)
      Topped with butter and salt, it was very tasty and satisfying.
      Admittedly I did blacken one side of the first loaf, but it was still edible except for the most burnt bits. 
      I gave it a second try and the second loaf was more evenly cooked.
   </p>
   <img src="assets/arboud_whole.jpg" height=400/>
   <img src="assets/arboud_halves.jpg" height=400/>
   <p>
      Since arboud instructions are not that abundant on the internet, I'll go into more detail on my approach than I usually do.
      From watching videos, it seemed like you could put the bread directly on the coals, or you could start it in a pan. 
      I opted for the pan because it was more familiar. 
      First I poured some flour and salt into a bowl and mixed them up. 
      Then I added a little water and whisked it up with a fork until it formed a nice dough- just slightly tacky.
      I took my cast iron pan and pre-heated it in the fire.
   </p>
   <p>
      Then I smooshed the dough onto the hot pan and pushed my fingers down to make dimples (like you would for a foccacia, and as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pft7vQLQcNE">this video</a>.)
      The pan went down in the firepit and I used a stick to move hot coals on top of the dough.
      When the top surface had set (which took only a couple minutes) I pulled it out of the pan and set it directly on top of the coals,
      so that the side that was against the pan was now against the coals. 
      Then I extracted it, rubbed a stick of butter over it like a large crayon, sprinkled with salt, and ate it.
      Very delicious, and very camping-friendly. It's pretty amazing to not measure anything and have fresh, hot bread in minutes.

   <h2>Arepas</h2>
   <p>The arepa is an ancient flatbread made with ground corn. They date back at least 3,000 years.
      But recently, they've become much easier to make due to the invention of precooked corn meal (masarepa precocida).
      All you have to do is mix warm water and salt into some flour, shape the dough into pucks, and fry them.
      I felt pretty confident in making these because I've made pupusas a few times. The dough is pretty much the same,
      but pupusas are stuffed with filling and usually go straight into a dry pan, whereas arepas get a little oil. 
 
      </p>
   <img src="assets/arepa_ingredients.jpg" width=400/>
   <p> 
      Arepas make a great side to one of my favorite breakfasts-for-dinner, desayuno tipico salvadoreño, 
      which in my limited experience involves scrambled eggs, avocado, tomato, hard white cheese, plantain, crema, and a lake of refried beans.
      My local diner serves this all day, with a stack of arepas on the side. 
</p>
<p>
   These came out pretty well in spite of me being hazed by the recipe on the back of the masarepa package, which definitely had the wrong ratio
   of water to flour.

   <h2>Baba</h2>
   <p>Babas are a street food from China, but I was surprised to find that they reminded me of pupusas. They're stuffed flatbreads, 
      but they're made with wheat instead of corn, and they should be flaky. They can be sweet or savory.
      I decided to fill mine with red bean paste (like the anpans above) but this time I bought the beans in a 
      can already mashed and sweetened.</p>
      <img src="assets/baba_ingredients.jpg" width=300/>
<p>
   I followed <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipe/lijiang-baba/tuq47ekty">
      this recipe</a> 
      for Lijiang-style baba, but I used shortening instead of lard and red beans instead of the nut and seed filling.
      And I got the water from the tap instead of a local spring. We work with what we have :/
   </p>

<p>
      The written recipe calls for a cup of lard, which seems like a lot for three servings. 
      But if you watch the video you can see that she only uses a little. I needed about a tablespoon for each baba.
      The written recipe also does not call for any salt. 
      I obeyed this directive on my first baba and then salted the remaining two.
</p>

<p>
   The technique shown in the video for getting the flaky layers is really neat and quite different from anything I've seen before in the world of laminated pastry.
   First you roll the dough out into a big rectangle and spread the lard (shortening) on it like sunscreen. 
   You roll that up like a sleeping bag into a long snake.
   Then you twist it like you're wringing out a washcloth.
   And then you knead it a few times.
   I found this pretty fun.
</p>

<p> To fill them, you shape the dough into a bowl, add the filling, seal it like a dumpling, and then roll it out into a flat disk.
   I found it pretty difficult to get the babas thin enough without getting a rupture. I guess drier fillings may be easier to work with.
   I was very happy with the flakiness on the outside and the layers on the inside. Next time I'll try to add more filling and roll them thinner.

   <h2>Babka</h2>
   <p>Babka is a braided yeast bread originating from Jewish communities in Ukraine and Poland, and now popular in New York City as a result of the Jewish diaspora.
      Chocolate is a popular modern filling, but you can also do savory fillings. Due to the braiding, the filling takes on a marbled appearance.
   </p>
   <p>   
      The braided pattern may look like it requires a lot of technique, but <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/chocolate-babka">in the recipe I followed</a>, it's actually quite easy to create. 
      You roll out the dough into a rectangle and spread the filling on top, leaving an inch bare on one of the short sides.
      You then roll it up into a cylinder, using the bare part to seal.
      Then slice in half lengthwise, thus making two striped half-pipes. 
      You then twist the two half-pipes around each other in the pan. So it's hardly even a braid- just twisting two ropes together- and yet you end up with loads of beautiful ribbons of dough and filling.
   </p>
   <p>
      This is an enriched bread so it has additional ingredients (milk, sugar, butter, and eggs). Plus you have to make the filling, which adds more ingredients to the pile.
      However, I realized after taking the picture (but fortunately just before measuring anything) that the recipe makes TWO babkas. 
      Given that I have a household of two and one entire babka is surely more than a serving size, I cut the recipe in half.
   </p>
   <img src="assets/babka_ingredients.jpg" height=400/>
   <p>Here's how it came out:</p>
   <img src="assets/babka_loaf.jpg" height=400/> 
   <p>And a slice so you can see the marbling:</p>

   <h2>Bagels</h2>
   <p>I've eaten hundreds if not thousands of bagels in my life... but I'd never tried making them until now.
      I followed <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/bagels-recipe">the King Arthur recipe</a> and watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9yvHcuGNo">this video</a> for tips on shaping them.
   It turns out there are several ways to shape bagels, and it's something people have Opinions about.
   The more "traditional" way is to make a snake and roll the ends together. Another way is to make a ball and pinch a hole through the middle.
   The former makes thinner, chewier bagels whereas the latter makes taller, fluffier bagels. I like my bagels soft and poofy so I went for the latter method.
   I also made half with rosemary and half with poppyseeds. In the ingredients picture, you'll also notice an ingredient you might not expect: brown sugar.
   One of the things that makes bagels, bagels is that they are poached in hot water before going into the oven. This helps them get a nice brown, chewy crust.
   People add a lot of different things to the poaching water, although I had trouble finding convincing info about what effect, if any, these additives have. Are they for luck...?
   The King Arthur recipe calls for non-diastatic malt powder OR barley malt syrup OR dark brown sugar. I didn't have any of these on hand but I thought light brown sugar would be close enough.
</p>
<img src="assets/bagels_ingredients.jpg" height=300/>
   <p>
     The result was OK. They were definitely bagels, but if I had bought them from a bakery, I probably wouldn't have become a repeat customer.
     I think the main thing that went wrong was that my yeast was very active and so they didn't need to prove nearly as long as the recipe suggested.
     They poofed up enormously, but then collapsed back down and got kind of wrinkly and sad.
     I will probably try these again at some point and aim to trust my instincts more and the clock less. 
     Also I will use instant yeast as the recipe suggests, instead of pre-proofing regular yeast.
   </p>

   <h2>Baghrir</h2>
   <p>Baghrir are semolina pancakes commonly made in North Africa. Their defining characteristic is being covered with holes, like a sponge, which readily accommodate toppings.
      Unlike American pancakes, you don't flip them.
      And (at least in <a href="https://moribyan.com/baghrir-moroccan-pancakes/">the recipe I used</a>), and unlike any bread we've covered so far, we are called to add both yeast AND baking powder.
      So we have a hybrid: it's both a yeasted bread and a quickbread.
   </p>
   <img src="assets/baghrir_ingredients.jpg" height=300/>
   <p>There's definitely a bit of technique for getting lots of holes to form. I got a decent number, but not as many as in the reference photos I saw.
The result was very light and fluffy, and nice with jam or the recommended butter syrup.

   <h2>Baguettes</h2>
   <p>Baguettes are perhaps the most famous French bread. They have a distinctive long and narrow shape,
      a crisp crust, and a complex fermented flavor.
      The crispy crust is achieved by baking them in the presence of steam. 
      If your oven doesn't have the ability to add steam (because you don't work in a bakery) there are several methods to produce it manually.
      <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-baguettes-recipe">The King Arthur recipe</a> calls for adding boiling water to a cast iron pan. Previously I've achieved this with ice cubes on a sheet pan.
   </p>
   <p>When it comes to the art of breadmaking, the French baguette has a pretty significant reputation.
      I'll admit I was a little intimidated to try it.
      But having made some, I actually think they're quite achievable (at least with the King Arthur recipe)
      and if you're interested and have at least some experience with yeasted bread, then you should go for it. 
   </p>
   <p>
      This was my first time making a poolish (a long slow pre-ferment added to the main dough).
      I really enjoyed seeing the poolish poof up after its overnight rise. It became huge, stanky, and jiggly :)
      I also had fun learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba2DHI299PU&t=3s">to shape the dough</a> (shaping is a big part of making baguettes). 
      Shaping dough always takes me back to childhood pottery class or even to preschool playdough days.

   </p>
<p>However, not everything went to plan with these, and I do think I'll benefit from a second attempt.
   Firstly, something was off with the dough from the start. 
   I left it in the mixer even longer than the maximum recommended time, but I think I needed to leave it even longer or add more flour,
   because it was very sticky and loose.
   Secondly, I used the wrong kind of pan to produce steam, so they came out very pale.
   But they were definitely baguettes so I'll call it a passing result.
   I used one to make a banh-mi-style sandwich (the banh-mi is a close relative of the French baguette) with marinated tofu, basil, and shaved carrots. Not bad at all.

   <h2>Bakarkani</h2>
   <p>Bakarkhani is an enriched flatbread hailing from South Asia. It's part of the Mughlai cusine
       (associated with the Mughal Empire) which also includes some more world-famous dishes like biryani, korma, 
       kofta, and kabaab. There are many different kinds; some are crispy and flaky while others are doughy. 
       They tend to have slashes or be pricked all over with a fork, giving them a recognizable appearance distinct from other flatbreads.
       Common flavor ingredients are saffron, poppy, cardamom, and the browned-butter flavors of ghee.
       These may be incorporated into the dough or sprinkled on top.
       I love cardamom and browned butter, so I went for <a href="https://www.whiskaffair.com/bakarkhani-roti/">this recipe</a>, which includes them and also calls for white poppyseeds.
       I only had black poppyseeds but I read that you can substitute them. 
       In the ingredients picture below, you'll see butter instead of ghee; I made the butter into ghee by boiling it in a saucepan and scooping off the whey.
       (You can also make clarified butter this way if you stop cooking it before it browns.)
   </p>
   <img src="assets/bakarkhani_ingredients.jpg" height=300/>
   <p>I really enjoyed making this bread because the dough smelled AMAZING. 
      The cardamom and ghee together were just heavenly.
      And it was a very pleasant dough to work with- neither sticky nor crumbly.
      I tried two lamination techniques- the one shown in the recipe and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Jc2h815n8Bg&t=0s">the one in this video-</a> but neither gave me very noticeable layers.
      Think less of a croissant and more of a dense southern biscuit.
      The cardamom flavor didn't come through very strongly into the bread- I think I might double it next time- and this may just be because my cardamom is old.
      The ghee flavor was definitely there, though.
      This is a fragrant, mildly sweet bread that's lovely for snacking. We also had it with a lentil curry and that was splendid as well.

 <h2>Balep korkun</h2>
 <p>This bread from Tibet is cooked in a pan and is leavened with baking soda.
   All you need is flour, water, and the baking soda. I also added some salt.
   (You might think this looks similar to naan, but naan is usually made with yeast and an enrichment like yogurt or egg.)

   I followed <a href="https://www.yowangdu.com/tibetan-food/tibetan-bread-balep.html">this recipe</a> a bit haphazardly.
   It was really a last-minute thing I threw together to go with some lentil soup.
   The result was just... bread. It was definitely bread but it had very little else going for it.

 <h2>Bammy</h2>
 <p>Bammies are an ancient cassava bread made by the indigenous people of Jamaica and they are still popular in Jamaica today.
   They're usually served with something savory like fish or beans.
   Cassava is also called yuca (but not yucca- that's a whole other plant). 
   It's a starchy root vegetable, somewhat like a potato. 
   You may have heard of cassava flour, but here we're working with the fresh stuff, either grated or pureed.
 </p>
<p>
   I followed <a href="https://thatgirlcookshealthy.com/jamaican-bammy-recipe/">this modern recipe</a> which calls for shaping the pulp into discs using a mold right in the pan. 
   You sear them once to solidify the shape, then soak them in coconut milk, and then cook them again.
   I was thinking I'd never made a twice-cooked, soaked bread like this before, but then it occurred to me that French toast also meets this description.
</p>
<p>
   I had never cooked with cassava before but I do love yuca fries so I was excited to learn how to work with it.
   I had a hard time peeling it at first. 
   It seems the trick is to make a cut through the brown peel <i>and</i> the white waxy layer underneath it,
   and then peel them both off in one piece.
   I initially tried to grate it on a box grater, but either something was wrong with my box grater or with my cassava or with me because that was not happening.
   So I cut it into pieces and put it in the food processor.
   The only pan-safe mold I had was this heart-shaped one, so we got heart-shaped bammies. Here they are getting their first fry:
 </p>
 <img src="assets/bammy_in_pan.jpeg" height=300/>
</body>

<p>
   And here they are after their coconut bath and their second fry.
   They reminded me of latkes (especially the ones made from leftover mashed potatoes) but with the distinctive flavor of cassava instead of potato.

<h2>Banana bread</h2>
<p>This might be the most quintessentially American bread we've seen on the list so far, and probably the one I've eaten the most times.
   Typically we're talking about a quickbread made in a loaf pan. It's a great way to use up unappealingly ripe bananas, which may explain why it took off in the Great Depression, a time when bananas were cheap and widely available and many people couldn't afford to waste food.
   I made mine with chocolate chips because to me, that's just the right way, even though <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-banana-bread-recipe">the recipe</a> lists them as an optional addition.
</p>
<img src="assets/banana_bread_ingredients.jpeg" height=250>
<p>I thought the result was fine. Nothing to write home about, but definitely banana bread.
</p>

<h2>Banh Mi</h2>
<p>You might know Banh Mi as a sandwich, but what makes a Banh Mi a Banh Mi when you can have them with all different sorts of fillings?
   It's actually the distinctive bread.
   This famous Vietnamese loaf is a close relative of the French baguette, but it tends to have a softer crust.
   The crust should be very crisp and thin, so that it cracks when you press on it. The crumb should be very fluffy.
   In my opinion, it makes a much better sandwich bread than the French-style baguette above, especially if you have TMJ problems (and I do).
</p>
<p>Banh Mi recipes often contain rice flour in addition to wheat flour, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=5FduMMBM-dQ">the recipe I followed</a>

<p>I think these came out really well and they were less work than the French baguette recipe. No poolish, less rising time, and easier shaping.
I was pretty happy with the shape and texture, although they did deflate a tiny bit because it was hard to work enough strength and elasticity into the dough.
Also, the recipe called for ascorbic acid and a dough improver, which I did not find at the grocery store and decided to omit. 
They made great sandwiches with marinated tofu, pickled carrots, and fresh parsley.

<h2>Bara brith</h2>
<p>This is an old Welsh recipe. The name means "speckled bread" and refers to the appearance of globs of dried fruit in the bread.
   The fruit is infused with black tea before adding to the batter.
   Old versions were certainly made with yeast and probably leaned breadier, though in recent decades it's commonly made as a quickbread and leans cakier.

   Brown raisins, golden raisins/sultanas, candied citrus peel, and currants are all common ingredients. 
   I have a <i>personal issue</i> with brown raisins so I stuck to the golden ones (AKA sultanas.)
   Not pictured below is 50 g of candied orange that I was very excited to use up, as it had been sitting in my fridge for some time since I made it earlier for a orange-gummy themed birthday cake.   
   This may look like a lot of ingredients but fear not, it's a fairly easy recipe. The only advanced planning required is that you have to soak the dried fruit in tea for at least three hours and preferably overnight.
   <a href="https://www.notquitenigella.com/2024/06/03/bara-brith">The recipe I used</a> calls for "mixed spice" which, I learned, is a winter spice blend similar to what we know in the US as "pumpkin pie spice."
   But unlike pumpkin pie spice it is likely to contain cardamom, and if you read my entry on bakarkhani then you know I LOVE cardamom.
   So in place of "mixed spice" I used half a teaspoon of cinnamon, a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg, a scant quarter teaspoon of powdered ginger, and a sprinkling each of cardamom, clove, and allspice.

   I did learn something very important from this experience, which is that oven manufacture varies significantly between regions.
   The recipe called for me to set my oven with "full fan" at 220 F. My oven doesn't have a fan setting so I ignored that and just put it at 220 F.
   This proved to be a near-fatal mistake.
   At the end of the baking time, the inside of the bread was still wet (raw). 
</p>
<p>
   It turns out that in some areas, most ovens have a convection setting. It runs a fan, moving the hot air around and cooking the food faster. 
   And in some areas (like Australia) most ovens can <i>only</i> operate with convection. 
   But if you live in the US, you likely have a "conventional oven" that does not have a convection/fan option at all.
   This makes a difference of about <strong>30 degrees</strong> in the necessary baking temp.
   Having learned all this, I turned my oven up to 350 F and put the loaf in for another 20 minutes and thankfully it came out okay.

   The result was nothing beautiful but it was very moist and tasted like Christmas.
