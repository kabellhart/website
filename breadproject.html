      <h1>Baking every bread in alphabetical order!</h1>
      <p>In late 2024, I got the weird idea to try baking every entry in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_breads">Wikipedia list of breads</a>, in alphabetical order.
         This endeavor has gotten me to try things I never would have thought of trying, to bake or to eat.
      </p>
      <p>I will try to snap the ingredients as well as the outcome, to give a sense of what's involved in each recipe.</p>
 
      <h2>Anadama bread</h2>
      <p>This is apparently a traditional bread from New England, but despite having lived 1/3 of my life in Massachusetts, I had never heard of it. I asked around and some New England natives knew it, and pronunciation was mixed between Anna-damn-uh and Ahna-dom-uh.
          It's a fairly ordinary yeast bread, baked in a tin, but with the addition of cornmeal and molasses. 
          Legend has it that the name comes from a man exclaiming "Anna, damn her" after growing fed up with his wife's meals of cornmeal mush and molasses, and inventing this bread in order to break the monotony of consuming these ingredients.
       </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.carolinescooking.com/anadama-bread/">It's an easy recipe</a> and would make a great introduction to yeasted breads. 
      </p>

      <p>It was delicious served warm with butter, but then, what isn't? But it was pretty stale on day 2. I bet it would make great french toast.

    <h2>Anpan</h2>
    <p>Anpans are lovely little yeast buns, usually filled with red bean paste and marked on top with a circle of sesame black seeds. 
      They were invented in Japan in 1875 by Yasubei Kimura, an ex-samurai who became a baker after the samurai class was dissolved.</p>
   <p>
      Anpanman, a superhero with an anpan for a head, is the subject of a children's picture book and anime series that teaches children about germs and food safety.
   Other characters can take a bite out of his head to regain their strength. Fortunately the baker character can just make him a new head.</p>
   <p>
      <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/anpan/">The recipe I used</a> involved a lot of kneading. It suggested a slapping technique where you whack the bread against the counter. I made this in November 2024 and it was honestly extremely therapeutic. But I think I kneaded so vigorously that I may have actually killed some of the yeast through mechanical injury. I definitely didn't get as much of a rise as the recipe said I was supposed to. The texture was a bit dense- almost like a bagel. Unfortunately I've never had the chance to try an anpan that was made by someone who knew what they were doing, so I don't know if that texture is intended. At some point I will make them again and try to get them fluffier.
   </p>

   <p>
   I wanted the beautiful contrast of black sesame seeds without the price, so I substituted black poppy seeds. 
   I also got my red beans at Market Basket and realized later that they were Central American red silk beans (frijol rojo de seda), which are a bit kidney-shaped (but not the same as kidney beans) and yet not the mung beans / adzuki beans used in East Asia. But they cooked down into a tasty red paste all the same.

   <h2>Appams</h2>
   <p>Appams are coconut and rice flour fritters popular in the state of Kerala, India. You can tear off pieces and use them to scoop up other foods. Or you can serve food in them, like a bread bowl, because they're cooked in a wok-shaped pan and come out bowl-shaped.
      The edges should be lacey from the popped bubbles, and browned to a crisp, while the middle should be stark white, soft, and fluffy. 
      Notably, this is our first gluten-free bread on the list and it's also vegan.  Paired with lentil curry, this is a nice option for diners with dietary restrictions.
   </p>
  <p>Appams are traditionally leavened with "toddy" or palm wine, which contains wild yeast. The sap from palm trees can be collected in the morning and by the afternoon the yeast has already fermented into something fairly boozy.
    Without access to fresh toddy, I resorted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=METruOPZ-2Y&list=PLrFfR1mtZCLFQZRPsGaCqb0JEwG8DPOsx">this lovely video recipe</a> that shows how to use dried yeast instead.
    It also gives options for using grated coconut or coconut milk.</p>
    <p>On my first attempt, I used coconut milk and I tried to make my own rice flour by grinding up raw rice. 
      It turns out I don't have a fancy enough blender for that, so my rice "flour" was too coarse and kept sinking out of the batter.
      On my second try I used store-bought rice powder and I decided to try grated coconut. This version worked much better for me.
   </p>
   <img src="assets/appam_ingredients.jpg" width=400/>
   <p>
      I found that making the appam batter is not hard, but there's a lot of technique in getting them properly cooked. You need to ladle in the right amount of batter,
      swirl the pan properly so that you get thin crispy edges and a thicker middle, use the right amount of heat while covering the pan to steam the middle,
      and use more heat and oil on the sides to get the edges to lift off the pan. It takes practice, and the right technique probably depends a lot on the pan. I used a nonstick wok, which seemed not ideal, but I learned to make it work.
   </p>
   <p>I was rewarded with crisp on the edges, fluffy in the middle, white and brown hoppers that smelled strongly of coconut. They made an ordinary lentil curry much more fun to eat. 
      I wasn't sure if the leftover batter would keep in the fridge, but I did try making some more a couple days later, and to my surprise they smelled less of coconut and had developed a more complex fermented flavor.

   <h2>Arboud</h2>
   <p>Arboud is an ancient Bedouin flatbread cooked directly in the embers of a fire.
      Unfortunately, in my apartment I'm not allowed to burn candles, let alone a wood fire,
   so I'll have to wait for camping weather and then circle back to this one. </p>
   <p>Update: I went camping and made arboud! </p>

   <h2>Arepas</h2>
   <p>The arepa is an ancient flatbread made with ground corn. They date back at least 3,000 years.
      But recently, they've become much easier to make due to the invention of precooked corn meal (masarepa precocida).
      All you have to do is mix warm water and salt into some flour, shape the dough into pucks, and fry them.
      I felt pretty confident in making these because I've made pupusas a few times. The dough is pretty much the same,
      but pupusas are stuffed with filling and usually go straight into a dry pan, whereas arepas get a little oil. 
 
      </p>
   <img src="assets/arepa_ingredients.jpg" width=400/>
   <p> 
      Arepas make a great side to one of my favorite breakfasts-for-dinner, desayuno tipico salvadore√±o, 
      which in my limited experience involves scrambled eggs, avocado, tomato, hard white cheese, plantain, crema, and a lake of refried beans.
      My local diner serves this all day, with a stack of arepas on the side. 
</p>
<p>
   These came out pretty well in spite of me being hazed by the recipe on the back of the masarepa package, which definitely had the wrong ratio
   of water to flour.

   <h2>Baba</h2>
   <p>Babas are a street food from China, but I was surprised to find that they reminded me of pupusas. They're stuffed flatbreads, 
      but they're made with wheat instead of corn, and they should be flaky. They can be sweet or savory.
      I decided to fill mine with red bean paste (like the anpans above) but this time I bought the beans in a 
      can already mashed and sweetened.</p>
      <img src="assets/baba_ingredients.jpg" width=300/>
<p>
   I followed <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipe/lijiang-baba/tuq47ekty">
      this recipe</a> 
      for Lijiang-style baba, but I used shortening instead of lard and red beans instead of the nut and seed filling.
      And I got the water from the tap instead of a local spring. We work with what we have :/
   </p>

<p>
      The written recipe calls for a cup of lard, which seems like a lot for three servings. 
      But if you watch the video you can see that she only uses a little. I needed about a tablespoon for each baba.
      The written recipe also does not call for any salt. 
      I obeyed this directive on my first baba and then salted the remaining two.
</p>

<p>
   The technique shown in the video for getting the flaky layers is really neat and quite different from anything I've seen before in the world of laminated pastry.
   First you roll the dough out into a big rectangle and spread the lard (shortening) on it like sunscreen. 
   You roll that up like a sleeping bag into a long snake.
   Then you twist it like you're wringing out a washcloth.
   And then you knead it a few times.
   I found this pretty fun.
</p>

<p> To fill them, you shape the dough into a bowl, add the filling, seal it like a dumpling, and then roll it out into a flat disk.
   I found it pretty difficult to get the babas thin enough without getting a rupture. I guess drier fillings may be easier to work with.
   I was very happy with the flakiness on the outside and the layers on the inside. Next time I'll try to add more filling and roll them thinner.

   <h2>Babka</h2>
   <p>Babka is a braided yeast bread originating from Jewish communities in Ukraine and Poland, and now popular in New York City as a result of the Jewish diaspora.
      Chocolate is a popular modern filling, but you can also do savory fillings. Due to the braiding, the filling takes on a marbled appearance.
   </p>
   <p>   
      The braided pattern may look like it requires a lot of technique, but <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/chocolate-babka">in the recipe I followed</a>, it's actually quite easy to create. 
      You roll out the dough into a rectangle and spread the filling on top, leaving an inch bare on one of the short sides.
      You then roll it up into a cylinder, using the bare part to seal.
      Then slice in half lengthwise, thus making two striped half-pipes. 
      You then twist the two half-pipes around each other in the pan. So it's hardly even a braid- just twisting two ropes together- and yet you end up with loads of beautiful ribbons of dough and filling.
   </p>
   <p>
      This is an enriched bread so it has additional ingredients (milk, sugar, butter, and eggs). Plus you have to make the filling, which adds more ingredients to the pile.
      However, I realized after taking the picture (but fortunately just before measuring anything) that the recipe makes TWO babkas. 
      Given that I have a household of two and one entire babka is surely more than a serving size, I cut the recipe in half.
   </p>

   <p>Here's how it came out:</p>

   <p>And a slice so you can see the marbling:</p>
